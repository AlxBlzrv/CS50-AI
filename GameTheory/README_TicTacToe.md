## Introduction

This project showcases an implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, utilizing the Minimax algorithm. It consists of two Python files:

1. **runner.py**: This file contains the main interface to start and play the game.
2. **tictactoe.py**: Here lies the logic behind the Tic-Tac-Toe game, implementing the Minimax algorithm for AI player decisions.

## Getting Started

To begin playing the game, simply clone this repository to your local machine and execute the `runner.py` file. The game will provide you with a user-friendly interface to enjoy the age-old battle of X's and O's against a smart AI opponent.

## Features

- **User Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface designed for easy navigation and enjoyable gameplay.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI opponent employs the powerful Minimax algorithm to ensure challenging and strategic gameplay.
- **Educational Purpose**: Developed as a learning project inspired by the CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course, this project serves as a practical demonstration of game theory concepts.
