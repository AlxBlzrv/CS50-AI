# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python Projects

Welcome to the repository for projects completed as part of the CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course!

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on various aspects of artificial intelligence, implemented using Python programming language. Each project demonstrates different concepts and techniques used in the field of artificial intelligence, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, and more.

## Projects:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm:**
   This project implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.

2. **Minesweeper AI:**
   This project implements an AI player for the classic Minesweeper game. The AI is capable of making informed decisions based on the current state of the game board, aiming to maximize the chances of winning.
3. **Crossword Puzzle Generator:**
   This project aims to create a program for generating crossword puzzles. It involves defining the structure of the puzzle grid and providing a list of words as input. The program then fills the grid with words in such a way that they intersect correctly, resulting in a fully functional crossword puzzle. The implementation includes constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) techniques to ensure that the generated puzzle adheres to the specified constraints and is solvable. The provided code includes classes for representing variables and the crossword puzzle itself, as well as methods for enforcing node and arc consistency, solving the CSP, and generating the final crossword puzzle.
4. *will be supplemented...*
